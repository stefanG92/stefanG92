Hi i'm Stefan Georgiev and i'm from Bulgaria.I'm Interested in Java Developing and now i study and JS.
I'm currently learning in SoftUni.And every day i'm on the computer and work for my education.
When I get more modules than mine
education I would like to start working in a company.
Every one which think that i can be useful, I will be very happy to work together.
In my profile there's imail adress, so person which wants to find me can to writing on my imail adress.

I will soon make my site with all the education certificates, photos that companies need.

I personally need a serious offer for an internship in a company, because i thought that the internship was very important in the profession.
In my activity at Github you can see how often I work and upload code because I write code every day.
